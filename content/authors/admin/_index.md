## Bio

Hello, I'm Moaad, a second-year student at **EURECOM** in a program leading to a French engineering degree, a "Diplôme d'Ingénieur" . The curriculum at EURECOM is taught entirely in English.

Internationally, this stage is equivalent to being a 1st-year master's student. 

My academic path started with two years in France's preparatory classes, aimed at entering **Grandes Écoles**. 


### Free time
In the midst of these academic pursuits, sometimes I find it fascinating to explore bigger pictures like cosmic theories such as relativity to understand the universe better specifically blackholes. 

Challenges and new situations excite me; they present opportunities to adapt and learn, which is a continuous focus for me. 

Beyond Academia and intellectual activities, I enjoying **football**, discovering **food from different cultures**, or simply **going out**.
